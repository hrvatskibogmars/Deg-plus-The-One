A shortcode based WordPress form builder that makes building custom login, registration and password reset forms stupidly simple.

== Description ==
Ever wanted to create a custom Login, Registration, Password Reset forms and Front-end User Profile that will conform to a WordPress (theme) design?
With knowledge of just **HTML & CSS**, code the form component in combination with our expressive shortcodes, make it pretty with CSS and ProfilePress will handle the rest.

Don’t know how to code? Get form designs from the [theme shop](http://profilepress.net/themes/) installable via the built-in theme installer.

You don't need to worry about server-side PHP validation, authentication and authorization. Simply code the forms in HTML with the help of the plugin form builder and ProfilePress will turn them into functional custom login, registration and password reset forms. **Magic**
